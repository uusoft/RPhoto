Introduction
=============
<p>This is a course project of me for Java EE course 2013 in <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn" target=_blank>Fudan University</a>. Obviously, it's project of online albums and photos management system, and it's very simple both in the whole design and technologies used. Users can login to the system and create some albums, then upload some photos. Besides, uses can add tags and comments to photos. As for social, users can simply share them albums within the site. </p>
<p>I'am new to Java EE and it's my first Java EE project and due to this reason, I just used some basic knowledge of Java EE such as Servlet, Java Bean, JSP custom tags and some front-end technologies. I just spent little time on the project and there are some bugs inevitably.</p>

How to run?
============
<p>It's quite simple actually. Just import the whole project import your MyEclipse and deploy the project to your Tomcat. Please don't forget to create a database(MySQL) for the project and import the SQL(doc/je1024065.sql).</p>
